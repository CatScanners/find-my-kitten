# Definition of Ready

- [ ] **Clear Description**: The task has a concise title and description (1-2 sentences).
- [ ] **Objective Defined**: The goal is specific (e.g., "Investigate SLAM algorithms for visual navigation" or "Implement IMU data fusion").
- [ ] **Dependencies Identified**: Blockers or prerequisites are listed (e.g., hardware access, prior research).
- [ ] **Effort Estimate**: Rough estimate in hours (e.g., 2-4h for research, 4-8h for coding).

# Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Written**: The feature/bugfix is implemented according to the task description.
- [ ] **Light Unit Testing**: Critical functions are tested (e.g., edge cases, nominal operation).
- [ ] **Session Testing**: The code is tested in a real or simulated environment (e.g., drone hardware-in-the-loop).
- [ ] **Documentation**: Code includes comments for complex logic and updates to the project README/wiki if needed.
- [ ] **Peer Review**: At least one team member has reviewed the code for correctness and style.
- [ ] **Integration Ready**: The code merges cleanly with the main branch and does not break existing functionality.
